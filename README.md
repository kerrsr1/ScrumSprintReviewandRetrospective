# ScrumSprintReviewandRetrospective

The attached .txt file contains my review and retrospective for CS 240 after participating in a Scrum team composed of my classmates. We were tasked with creating a travel application for a fictional travel company, SNHU Travel. By participating in this process, I was able to gain experience in communicating with a diverse audience that included technical staff such as developers and testers as well as non-technical staff such as managers and stakeholders. I was also able to experience agile methodology first-hand. This retrospective contains my reflections on how the agile process worked best for our hypothetical customer, how communication occured, and how the use of a task management application such as Jira kept us on track.
